# üîê Smart Lock System with ESP32 + RFID + Relay + Servo + Blynk

This project is a smart lock system built using ESP32, RFID (RC522), a relay module, a servo motor, and integrated with Blynk for monitoring access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

- ESP32 (WROOM Devkit)
- RFID Reader RC522
- Relay Module (1 channel)
- SG90 Servo Motor (or similar)
- 12V Door Lock (optional)
- Jumper Wires
- Power Supply (e.g. 5V 2A)

## üõ† Notes

- Use a **common GND** between ESP32, Servo, and Relay.
- Servo should be powered via **external 5V source**, not directly from ESP32 to prevent brownout.
- Relay can control 12V electronic lock or magnetic lock depending on use case.
- Make sure your RFID card's UID is added to the code (`masterUID[]`).

---

## üì± Blynk Integration

- Create a Blynk template and use `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_ID` and `BLYNK_TEMPLATE_NAME`.
- Virtual pins used:
  - `V0`: Access log/status
  - `V1`: Lock state (1 = open, 0 = locked)

---

## ‚úÖ Status

- [x] RFID authentication
- [x] Servo unlock mechanism
- [x] Relay control
- [x] Blynk access status
- [ ] Blockchain integration (next step)

Feel free to fork or customize the wiring based on your module pinout!
